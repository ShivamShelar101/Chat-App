# Chat-App
 I created an advanced chat application using the MERN Stackâ€”MongoDB for the database, ExpressJS and NodeJS for the server, and ReactJS with Bootstrap for the sleek, user-friendly frontend. This combination allowed for seamless real-time communication while ensuring a responsive and visually appealing interface.
